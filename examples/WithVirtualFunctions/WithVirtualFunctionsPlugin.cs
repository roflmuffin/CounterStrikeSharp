    // In this example, we are going to cover each method.
    // Note: we won't cover RE here.

    // 1 -> Working with a signature:

    // this example shows that you can just pass the signature of the function
    // Note: CS# assumes the server binary by default. there are overloads that allow you to specify a different binary.
    // this example will continue inside the "Load" method.

    // 3 -> Working with a vtable offset without an instance:

    // Note: CS# assumes the server binary by default. there are overloads that allow you to specify a different binary.
    // Note: here, CS# uses the 'CCSPlayerController' (TArg1) argument type name as the "vtable symbol" and you should only rely on this if you know what you are doing.
