## FollowCS2ServerGuidelines

Per [CS2 Server Guidelines](https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/server_guidelines/), certain plugin
functionality will trigger all of the game server owner's Game Server Login Tokens
(GSLTs) to get banned when executed on a Counter-Strike 2 game server.

Enabling this option will block plugins from using functionality that is known to cause this.
This option only has any effect on CS2. Note that this does NOT guarantee that you cannot
receive a ban.

> [!NOTE]
> Disable this option at your own risk.
